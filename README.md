**Introduction**  
The nvmesh-shell tool is an open source and free cli tool providing a regular cli tool/program which can be used for writing OS shell scripts, e.g. bash shell scripts, or one-liners.
Additionally, it also offers an interactive shell interface by itself.
All subcommands are available any way you decide to use it.

**Install**  
You can install the nvmesh-shell by either using `pip install-nvmesh` or downloading/cloning this git repository using
`git clone https://github.com/Excelero/nvmesh-shell`, cd into the
nvmesh-shell newly created directory and type `pip install .`

In either case, you need the pip python package available and ready on your computer.

**Usage**  
On your terminal, type `nvmesh-shell` to start the interactive shell
session. For more help and a list of available sub-commands type `help`
or `help <sub-command>`.

Example: `nvmesh # help list`

Alternatively, you can use it and interact with it like a regular CLI
tool if required.

Example: `nvmesh-shell list volumes -d`
